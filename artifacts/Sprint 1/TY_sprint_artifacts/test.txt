Sprint 1 - Tae Yoon (Scrum Report)
Task: Set up successful API routing between frontend and backend

- Built the complete API pipeline connecting the frontend to the database
- Created the database layer (src/lib/db.js) with connection pooling and automatic table initialization for surveys and reports
- Created backend API routes:
    1. POST /api/surveys - accepts survey submissions, validate input, stores in database, and triggers report generation
    2. GET /api/surveys - retrives all surveys with their associated reports
    3. GET /api/reports - retrieves all reports or a single report by survey ID
    4. GET /api/health - health check endpoint that verifies database connectivity

    1. Frontend Survey Form
    2. POST /api/surveys
    3. Database
    4. Report generation
    5. Database
    6. GET /api/reports
